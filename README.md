# Othello/Reversi! EE 5450 Module 1 Summative
Othello/Reversi Game 
(Originally was for kivy but switched to MQTT)

Welcome to Othello! For those who do not know about othello it is a board game played on a 8x8 uncheckered board. The game is for two players and the point of the game is to convert the other players pieces into you own.


# How the game works!

The game will ask which piece you would like to be.
In this case X or O, either player can choose to input their preferred choice or if not whoever inputs their choice first gets to be the preferred piece

*Player 1 picks X, PLayer 2 will be O

The game will then state if player 1 or player 2 will go first
It will print the board and ask for input by the player. 

# Game ends when no more tiles can be placed and all spaces are taken up
 
# board_d()
A board is drawn in a 8x8 board with empty spaces
